# Gemini Code Assistant Context

## Directory Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive set of scripts and configuration files for automating the setup of a macOS machine. It is designed to be a "dotfiles" repository, enabling a user to quickly and consistently configure a new Mac with their preferred applications, tools, and settings.

The primary goal of this repository is to ensure consistency between machines, followed by ease of setup and maintenance, and finally, minimizing the total setup time. The long-term vision is to evolve this personal tool into a framework that other users can easily adapt for their own needs.

## Key Principles

*   **Consistency:** The setup should be repeatable and result in the same configuration every time.
*   **Automation:** The process should require minimal human intervention.
*   **Idempotency:** Scripts should be safely re-runnable without causing unintended side effects.
*   **Maintainability:** The codebase should be well-organized, documented, and easy to update.

## Key Files and Directories

*   **`bootstrap.sh`**: The initial entry point for setting up a new machine. It's responsible for installing essential tools like Homebrew and preparing the system for the main installation process.

*   **`install.sh`**: The main installation script. It orchestrates the setup process by calling the `install.sh` scripts within the various subdirectories.

*   **`brew/`**: Contains the Homebrew configuration.
    *   `Brewfile`: A list of all the applications and command-line tools to be installed via Homebrew. This file is automatically generated by a script.
    *   `install.sh`: Installs Homebrew and then uses the `Brewfile` to install all the specified packages.

*   **`shell/`**: Configures the shell environment.
    *   `install.sh`: Installs the Fish shell, the Oh My Fish framework, and sets up the shell configuration files.
    *   `*.fish`: Various Fish shell configuration files for setting up aliases, functions, and environment variables.

*   **`osx/`**: Contains scripts for customizing macOS settings.
    *   `install.sh`: Executes all the `.sh` files in this directory.
    *   `*.sh`: Individual scripts that modify specific macOS settings using the `defaults` command.

*   **`alfred/`**, **`iterm2/`**, **`istatmenus/`**, **`spectacle/`**: These directories contain the configuration files for their respective applications. The setup for these is currently a manual process.

## Backlog & Future Vision

The backlog is tracked in GitHub Issues. Key areas for improvement include framework vision, secrets management, and improved testing/verification.
