Review the provided content against my writing style and suggest improvements.

## My Writing Style

**Tone**: Grounded, modest, technical. Clear and direct—no fluff or corporate jargon. Calm and confident, never boastful. Simple but not simplistic.

**Voice**: Understatement over big claims. Clarity over cleverness. No dramatic, salesy, or self-important language. No hero narratives ("I drive clarity," "I transform engineering"). Specific examples over abstract generalities.

**Phrasing**:
- Shorter over longer
- Concrete over vague
- Technical but accessible, not academic
- Avoid overselling adjectives ("revolutionary," "world-class," "groundbreaking")
- Prefer: "Here's what I'm exploring…", "Here's how I think about…", "A practical approach is…"

**Content focus**: Intelligent engineering, AI-assisted software delivery, architecture, developer experience. Writing should capture thinking + practical value. Honest, thoughtful, useful.

## Review Process

### 1. Tone & Voice Review
Flag anything: too marketing-y, self-important, vague, dramatic, buzzword-heavy, wordy, or academic.

### 2. ChatGPT Tells Check
Flag these AI-generated content patterns:

**Structural tells**:
- Abstract wisdom without specifics ("Better thinking in produces better thinking out")
- Missing the "I" voice — abstract "we" throughout instead of personal experience
- Overly parallel/poetic structures ("Not X. Not Y. Z." for dramatic effect)
- Triple constructions ("extend your reach, accelerate your ideas, and surface possibilities")
- Blockquote overuse for emphasis

**Language tells**:
- Buzzword soup ("curiosity, continuous improvement, and lightweight experimentation")
- Generic thought leadership ("AI is reshaping how we think while we deliver")
- Salesy phrases ("That's the real craft of...", "Become harder to compete with over time")
- Passive corporate constructions ("Intentional adoption prevents accidental dependencies being created")
- Redundancy dressed as emphasis ("hallucinated APIs that do not exist")
- Em-dash overuse — most humans don't write with em-dashes; prefer commas, periods, or parentheses

**Content tells**:
- No friction or uncertainty — reads like settled truth
- No personal anecdotes — principles without stories
- Aspirational framing ("The engineers I admire most...") instead of observation ("The engineers I've seen do this well...")

### 3. Authenticity Check
Does this sound like something the author would actually say? Look for:
- Personal anecdotes from actual experience
- "I" for opinions, "we" to include the reader
- Concrete failure modes witnessed firsthand
- Specific comparisons (bad prompt vs good prompt)
- Acknowledged uncertainty ("These principles aren't final...")
- Named tools and techniques, not generic advice

### 4. Clarity & Concision Review
- Identify unclear sentences, unnecessary complexity
- Flag redundancy (can any phrase be cut?)
- Check for sentences that could be split for punch
- Apply Elements of Style: omit needless words, use active voice, place emphatic words at sentence end

### 5. Specific Suggestions
3–5 targeted improvements with before/after examples. Prioritize:
- Cutting ChatGPT-isms
- Adding personal voice where missing
- Tightening wordy constructions
- Making abstract statements concrete

### 6. Summary
State whether the piece passes or needs revision. If revision needed, indicate severity (minor polish vs significant rewrite).
